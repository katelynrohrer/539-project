For my project, I'm planning to do an old Kaggle competition that I found and sounded interesting.
In this competition, we are tasked to label the sentiment of a Twitter (X) tweet as positive, negative, or neutral.
Here's the link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tweet-sentiment-extraction/overview

My plan is to give each word a sentiment score during training so that I can
then use the score of each word to analyze the sentiment of a new tweet.
For this, I plan on using word2vec with skip-grams and negative sampling loss.

Here's the link to the GitHub repo that I'll be working on: https://github.com/katelynrohrer/539-project
and here's the link to my (very blank) Github pages page: https://katelynrohrer.github.io/539-project/
